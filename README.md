# COVID-19 Model

## Objectives
- Develop foundational skills in data science and utilize machine learning techniques to model COVID-19 time series data collected in the United States. 
- Visualize data and model predictions with a geographic graphic to see the spread of disease over time.

## Getting Started
### Installing JupyterLab
1. Navigate to project folder and create a virtual environment
    1. Create environment:
        ```bash 
        python -m venv (environment name)
        ```
    2. Activate environment

        ```bash
        source ./(environment name)/bin/activate
        ```
        Windows:
        ```powershell
        venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
        ```
2. Install required python packages using [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt):
    ```shell
    pip install -r ./requirements.txt
    ```
3. Start JupyterLab
    ```shell
    jupyter lab
    ```
